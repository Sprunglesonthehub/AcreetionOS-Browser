# Closing Down this project, as we don't have enough volunteers to maintain this fork.
I loved the idea, and really wanted for us to have our own browser, but I've come to the conclusion that with the ISO images I'm having to manage, as well as the website, youtube videos, etc, I just can't add this to my plate as a full time job. It would be neglected. Which wouldn't be fair to the end user, nor the project. So we will shelf this until someone else can step in on this. 

Thanks for understanding,

# AcreetionOS Browser
Brought to you by the AcreetionOS Team.

Are you wondering why we decided to make a web browser? Well, Firefox can't be trusted anymore, and LibreWolf has gone woke. So, we just kind of had too.

# We do this out of necessity.

If it weren't for LibreWolf going woke/politically-motivated, and Firefox taking telemetry data, we wouldn't be doing this. But here we are. We are working on a Firefox-based, Librewolf-based browser without politics, or data collection from upstream organizations.

We make the promise that we are not going to take data from you, UNLESS YOU KNOW, which means you can connect to the internet in a secure and non-worrying way.

I'm sick and tired of politics, so leave at the door this repository, as any political/woke contributions will be rejected.
